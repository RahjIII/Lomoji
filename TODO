+ write the readme.md

+ provide an example extras.xml override file for LO

----DONE!----------------------------------
+ write the docs.

+ Redo the default annotations lookup functions.

+ Provide a 'toascii' filter that doesn't do lo character transliteration, in
case people prefer that.

+ See if the 'oneoffs' can be put into a local cldr file. (so that "with" can
be localized.)  Yep, it works.

+ make lomoji.pc inherit the prefix and version from the makefile.

+ The uplus filter needs to work on full graphemes not just on the first codepoint.

+ toascii on the annotations names.. turns out they have some unicode in them.
see :womenâ€™s_room: for example.  Also quotemarks.  See ./lomoji -s :japan
